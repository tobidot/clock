# Game Design Document: Space-Adventure

## Protagonist: The Unseen Maintenance Officer

You're a low-ranking human maintenance officer who stayed behind on the derelict S.S. Spindlefork.

## Prolog

Everyone evacuated in a panic over a false alarm labeled "Quantum Sock Infestation."

You missed the memo because your inbox was full of expired coupons.

## Game Expectency

The entire ship is deserted—no people, no voices, no AI companions—just beeping consoles,
stuck drawers, and signs warning you not to open Panel 7-B unless you enjoy mild existential dread.

You are never shown on-screen—your presence is implied through item interaction, occasional flavor text that reacts as if you’re thinking, and visible movement of tools and components.

The result? A pure item-based puzzle adventure with no dialogue, no characters, but full of personality.

## Game Logic

Mouse Cursor / Item Interactions:

Cursor changes over hotspots (classic pixel hunt moments, but fair and readable).

Right-click inspects, left-click picks up/uses.

Inventory pops up from the bottom of the screen.

## Environmental Feedback:

Items move, rotate, or animate when used.

Doors open, panels spark, slime oozes, lights flicker.

Sometimes objects react with sarcastic UI messages, like:

"Congratulations, you've unlocked a janitor's closet. Your mother must be proud."

## Narration / Humor Tone:

The game responds like a mix between an unhelpful manual and an annoyed ship's manual:

"The console reads: 'Input password.' The console is also dusty. That won’t help, but it's good to know."
"You try using the mayonnaise on the control panel. The panel, somehow, looks disappointed in you."

## Player's Role & Motivation

You, the unnamed and unseen maintenance officer, just want to:

Reboot the ship, so the emergency systems stop screaming at you every 3 minutes.

Send a distress signal in case anyone remembers you're here.

Escape, or at least find snacks that haven't become sentient.

You have no weapons, no AI companions, no comms—just your brain, your inventory, and the slowly failing internal gravity.
