# Playthrough Rundown

All steps the player needs to go through in this game

## Steps

### 🪐 Scene 1: Player Cabin

- Try to access your terminal - it requires a password you forgot.
- Find the password in your jacket
- Read messages from terminal
  - understand there has been an evacuation alert
  - learn that the door
- Learn that the maintenance door is sealed and requires a security badge you’ve definitely “misplaced.”

Find the badge stuck under a used emergency ration tray, which you must dislodge using a toothbrush or similar item.

### 🔧 Scene 2: Maintenance Corridor

Use the badge to open the sealed door and enter a dim, flickering maintenance corridor.

Discover a broken utility bot blocking the path, leaking suspicious ooze.

In a side cabinet, collect an adhesive patch, a circuit fuse, and a can labeled “Universal Coolant.”

Patch up the bot with these items in the right order (goop first, fuse second, coolant last).

Bot wakes up, mutters nonsense, and unblocks your way before shorting out with a burp.

### 📡 Scene 3: Control Deck

Enter the control deck and find the escape pods are all gone — except one, locked behind a blast door.

Access a secondary console, which needs a command override key and fuel pod unlock code.

Solve a light-based puzzle using reflections from console glass to discover the override key hidden in a side drawer.

The unlock code is partially visible on a sticky note... the rest appears under UV light (solved by plugging in a glowing plant lamp from the cabin).

Activate the escape pod system — but there's not enough power.

### ⚡ Scene 4: Engineering Hatch (mini scene / subroom)

Crawl into the power hatch and reroute backup energy using colored fuse rods with strange labels ("Mostly Blue", "Too Orange", "Kind of Greenish").

Solve the sequence puzzle (based on notes scribbled on the inside of a takeout box).

Return to the control deck — escape pod charges up.

Climb into the pod, but it won’t launch until you “verify lifeform ID” with a scanned item...

### 🎉 Scene 5: Escape Pod (Final Interaction)

Use your mug (with lipstick mark + your name on it) or your used towel to spoof ID.

Escape pod launches — and immediately hits space traffic.

Fade to black with a final text:

“Congratulations! You survived. Possibly. Depending on trajectory and snacks.”
